          <p>Violence against women and girls (VAWG) is one of the most oppressive forms of gender inequality and stands as a fundamental barrier to equal participation of women and men in social, economic, and political spheres. Such violence impedes gender equality and the achievement of a range of development outcomes. VAWG is a complex and multifaceted problem that cannot effectively be addressed from a single vantage point.</p>

    <p>Violence against women and girls (VAWG) is abuse that is targeted at women or girls because of their gender and it affects women and girls disproportionately but men can be abused too. It is important that VAWG is not seen as a series of incidents or assaults which a woman or girl experiences, but as a pattern of violent or controlling behaviour that seeks to achieve power and control over them. VAWG has a very big impact on the physical safety, health and emotional well-being of individuals, and impacts on families, carers, children and the community as a whole.</p>

    <p>Abuse can happen to anyone regardless of economic status, gender, ethnicity, faith, sexuality or age. Although we recognise that that the issues in this plan have a disproportionate effect on women (97 per cent of victims of abuse in Tower Hamlets are women), we also recognise that boys and men are victims of violence too.</p>

        <p>Sexual violence is any sexual contact that is unwanted or against someone’s will. It includes all forms of sexual acts including rape, sexual assault, sexual touching, sexual harassment, sexting or threats of sexual violence. Sexual violence means any touching that you don’t want or that makes you feel uncomfortable, including when you don’t feel able to say no. Sexual violence is never your fault, no matter what you were wearing, who you were with, where you went or how much you had been drinking.</p>

    <p>It is estimated that 35 per cent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner at some point in their lives. However, some national studies show that up to 70 per cent of women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner in their lifetime.</p>

    <p>Domestic violence is a pattern of behavior used to maintain power and control over an intimate partner or family member. It is a serious national problem that knows no racial, religious, cultural or economic boundaries. Victims can be of any age, race, sexual orientation, gender or marital status and represent a variety of socio-economic backgrounds and education levels. Intimate partner violence is primarily a crime against women. Although domestic violence affects women, men, children and elders, women are most often the victims and each year 1.5 million women are assaulted by a partner or loved one.</p>
        
     <p>Domestic violence not only affects those who are abused, but may also negatively impact family, friends, co-workers, other witnesses and the community at large. Exposure to domestic violence also has profound effects on children. Research indicates that as many as 10 million children per year may witness or be victims of violence in their homes. There is a correlation between domestic violence and child abuse, which may result in a child being physically injured as a direct result of domestic violence. Even if there is no physical harm inflicted upon a child, being a witness to domestic violence in the home often causes adverse effects.</p>

        <header>Female Genital Mutilation</header>
        <article>
        <p>The term female genital mutilation (FGM) includes any injury to woman or girl’s genitalia for reasons other than medical ones. FGM is sometimes called female circumcision, but the implications of female circumcision are quite different from those of male circumcision.  4 in 5 of these operations worldwide are performed by a traditional practitioner, often in unsanitary conditions, with serious health implications. FGM is most common in the north-eastern, western, and eastern regions of Africa, and some parts of the Middle East and Asia. More than 200 million girls and women alive today are estimated to have experienced FGM in the 30 countries where it is most common.</p>
       
        <p>FGM has no health benefits and involves damaging healthy female genital tissue and can cause short-term and long-term physical and psychological damage. It can cause severe bleeding and problems with urinating and menstruating. It also increases risks of infections and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and can also cause complications in pregnancy and childbirth. </p>

          <p>Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) is a form of sexual abuse in which a person(s) exploits, coerces and/or manipulates a child or young person into engaging in some form of sexual activity in return for something the child needs or desires and/or for the gain of the person(s) perpetrating or facilitating the abuse.</p>
         
          <p>The key factor that distinguishes cases of CSE from other forms of child sexual abuse is the concept of exchange, whereby the child or young person is coerced or manipulated into engaging in sexual activity in return for something they need or desire and/or for the gain of those perpetrating or facilitating the abuse. What  the child or young person receives in return can include both tangible items and/or more intangible things such as attention, perceived love or affection or a sense of value or belonging.</p>
         
          <p>Making the child or young person believe they are in control, because they are getting something in return, is part of this abusive process. Fear of what might happen if the young person does not comply, can also be a significant influencing factor.</p>

        <article>
         <p>A lot of people think stalking is something that just happens to celebrities, but the reality is that it can happen to anyone. Stalking can be defined as persistent and unwanted attention that makes you feel pestered and harassed. It includes behaviour that happens two or more times, directed at or towards you by another person, which causes you to feel alarmed or distressed or to fear that violence might be used against you. What makes the problem particularly hard to cope with is that it can go on for a long period of time, making you feel constantly anxious and afraid. Sometimes the problem can build up slowly and it can take a while for you to realise you are caught up in an ongoing campaign of abuse.</p>

    <p> Harassment refers to repeated attempts to impose unwanted communications and contact upon a victim in a manner that could be expected to cause distress or fear in any reasonable person. Stalking and harassment are similar but different forms of VAWG and so have traditionally been considered together in legislation.</p>

        <article>
    <p>Violence against women and girls is rooted in gender-based discrimination and social norms and gender stereotypes that perpetuate such violence. Given the devastating effect violence has on women, efforts have mainly focused on responses and services for survivors. However, the best way to end violence against women and girls is to prevent it from happening in the first place by addressing its root and structural causes.</p>

    <p>Prevention should start early in life, by educating and working with young boys and girls promoting respectful relationships and gender equality. Working with youth is a “best bet” for faster, sustained progress on preventing and eradicating gender-based violence. While public policies and interventions often overlook this stage of life, it is a critical time when values and norms around gender equality are forged.</p>
       
    <p>Prevention entails supporting the implementation of the agreed conclusions of the 57th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) that placed a strong focus on prevention through the promotion of gender equality, women’s empowerment and their enjoyment of human rights. It also means making the home and public spaces safer for women and girls, ensuring women’s economic autonomy and security, and increasing women’s participation and decision-making powers—in the home and relationships, as well as in public life and politics.Working with men and boys helps accelerate progress in preventing and ending violence against women and girls. They can begin to challenge the deeply rooted inequalities and social norms that perpetuate men’s control and power over women and reinforce tolerance for violence against women and girls.</p>
